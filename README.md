# About Me
My name is Julia. I am a Masters student at the Univeristy of Arizona studying Geographic Information Systems Technology. During normal work hours I am a Patient Care Coordinator at Banner University of Arizona Cancer Center. My best friend in the whole world is a french bulldog named Frankie. In my spare time I write, record and produce music with my partner in our home studio. For me, singing is pure joy. That and a strong cup of rock oolong tea. I could go on and on about myslef but I think this will suffice.
